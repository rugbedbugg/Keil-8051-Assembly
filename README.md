# Keil 8051 Assembly

This repository contains **8051 microcontroller assembly programs** written and tested using **Keil µVision**.
It is primarily meant as a **learning reference** while studying microcontrollers and low-level programming.

The code focuses on understanding how the 8051 works at the register and instruction level, rather than abstracting things away.

## Contents

* Basic 8051 assembly programs
* Register-level operations (A, B, R registers, ports)
* Arithmetic instructions (`ADD`, `SUBB`, `MUL`, `DIV`)
* Loops, jumps, and control flow
* Simple experiments aligned with academic coursework

Each file is commented to explain **what the instruction does and why it is used**, making it easier to follow along.

## Tools Used

* **Keil µVision**
* **Intel 8051 architecture**
* Assembly language (`.asm`)

## Purpose

This repository is:

* A personal archive of 8051 assembly practice
* A reference for revising concepts before exams or labs
* A place to experiment and break things safely

It is **not** intended to be an optimized library or production-ready codebase.

## Notes

* Programs are written with clarity in mind, not minimum instruction count
* Comments may be verbose by design
* Assumes basic familiarity with microcontrollers
